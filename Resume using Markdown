About me:
---
I've been working in the Technical Writing space for over 15 years, and I love what I do. I have deep experience working with nearly every type of content including: **developer content**, **compliance**, and **UX**. I'm looking for a company/organization that encourages people to challenge themselves, be authentic, creative, and empowered. For me, work is more about the challenge, the culture, and the environment, than about the paycheck. I thrive when collborating with smart, creative, passionate and engaged people. 
When junior writers ask what makes *good* writing, I typically say: clear, concise, relevant, and functional content.
