## Introduction

I’ve been working in the software and services space for more than 17 years, and I love what I do. I have deep experience working with every type of content including **cybersecurity and compliance**, **developer documentation**, and **UX**, and call myself a content engineer. I thrive when working and collaborating with engaged and enthusiastic people, working in an Agile environment, and remotely in Teams. I thrive when collborating with smart, creative, passionate and engaged people. 
I know what makes good writing: clear, concise, functional, and relevant.
